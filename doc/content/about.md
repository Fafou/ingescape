## ingeScape is a platform made of:

- A **portable software library**, which is multi-OS (Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, etc.) and multi-language (C, C++, Objective-C, Python, QML, etc.) to connect software agents forming operational systems.
- A **visual editor** bringing added-value to non-developers (diagnostic, supervision, communication flows, scenarios & behaviors, data exploitation, etc.) at various stages of your projects.
- A **set of software agents** addressing a large scope of services (i/o devices, embedded devices, databases, network protocols and formats, web & multimedia, augmented reality & multimodal interactive environments, etc.).

ingeScape enables multidisciplinary teams to **iteratively design, build and run complex systems involving human interactivity**, using new/existing software and hardware. The ingeScape platform is already in use is [various R&D and operational environments](/#work).


## Why did we create it ?
Modern complex systems are **interactive**, **distributed** and **heterogeneous** making network programming, user experience and system architecture increasingly difficult to handle...

Building a modern operational system engages many stakeholders with different views, skills and needs: 
- system engineers and software developers, 
- hardware experts and platform integrators,
- end-users, UX designers, domain experts, human factors specialists, etc.
As a system iteratively evolves in time, **foundations** should be **strong** and **structure** should be **flexible**, from the early works to the final product.

**ingeScape is here to bring a straightforward, scalable and robust solution to these challenges.**
